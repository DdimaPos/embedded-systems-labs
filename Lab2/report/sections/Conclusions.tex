\section{Conclusion}

Completions of this laboratory work have provided me 
insightful information about the basics of microelectronics,
the embedded systems and details about how the hardware and software
interacts to provide the desired results.

First laboratory work covered trivial use case of a microcontrolled
board, specifically building a valid circuit that contains a led and
a resistor and controlling the state of the led using the serial interface.
This work was a good introduction that layed the foundation of the future 
process of work. Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Designing the software by dividing the abstraction layer and the
    driver layer. Program now is portable to any device.
  \item Report template that will be used accross all the ES laboratory works
    which is designed according to TUM guildelines
  \item Hands on experience on working with Arduino UNO other microcontroller
    boards
  \item Understanding the basics of the interaction with peripherics (sensors, leds, resistors, etc).
\end{enumerate}

This laboratory work is a good foundation in the further works, where the focus 
will be on developing further the engineering mindset.
