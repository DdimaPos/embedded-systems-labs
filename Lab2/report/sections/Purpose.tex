\section{Purpose of laboratory work}

Purpose of the laboratory work is to study and use the STDIO library for serial communication
and implementing a programm that would permit controlling the led with the following commands:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item "led on" - turn the LED on
  \item "lef off" - turn the LED off
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Objectives of the laboratory work}

Laboratory work has the following objectives that should be achieved:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Understanding the basic principles of the serial communication with MCU
  \item Using the STDIO library for input/output message exchange
  \item Designing an application that interprets commands sent through serial interface
  \item Developing the code in a modular architecture, with separate functionalities for controling the peripherics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem definition}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Configure application for interaction using STDIO library through serial interface for 
    text exchange through terminal
  \item Design an application for the MCU board that will intercept commands through terminal through serial
    interface to set up the state of the LED
      \begin{itemize}
        \item "led on" for turning on the LED
        \item "led off" for turning off the LED
        \item system should respond with text messages that confirm the state change
        \item for text exchange the stdio library should be used
      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
